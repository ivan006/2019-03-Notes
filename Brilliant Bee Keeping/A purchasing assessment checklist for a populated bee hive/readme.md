# Theoretical assessment

## Quality of the box
- Material 
	- is it ply wood or solid pine wood?
- Finishing 
	- is the finish parafin wax or what?
- Age 
	- how old is the box and its frames?
- Photo 
	- what does a photo of the hive look like? ---------------
- Brood configuration 
	- The optimal and standard configuration is for the brood to inhabit a brood box, sometimes the brood will volinterily inhabit a super which is suboptimal

## Quality of the swarm
- Queen patern - is there a queen patern? (im not sure what this means)
- Queen 
	- the there a queen?
- Size 
	- how populated is the hive (this can be measured by the how populated the brood chamber is)?
- Age 
	- did the swarm just move in/how old is the swarm? -----------------
