# A-admin

## What
A-admin is an asset oriented admin and aledgedly leads to social harmony


## Why 

Unlike p-admin (people oriented admin) his leads to social harmony as people are simply not as reliable as assets. For example imagine that instead of voting for the next president we voted for the next government budget spending plan? 


## How
To practice a-admin you must manage assets with the use of asset, unlike p-admin inwhich you must use people to manage other people.
