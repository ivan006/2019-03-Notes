# Harmony management

Harmony management is a management technique thats leads to social harmony.

Our lives are impacted hugely by the way we manage them. Some managment techniques lead away from harmony and other towards it.

I've observed the types of managment techniques that lead away from harmony are the kinds that are people oriented, and the kind that lead towards harmony are asset oriented. 

Asset oriented managment is the type that both makes primary use of and focuses on the managment of assets. It's alternative is people oriented managment which both makes primary use of and focuses on the management of people. I believe this phenomena is due to the fact that assets are more reliable than people as people have limitations that assets do not.

For an illustration of the difference between asset and people oriented management imagine, for a moment, that instead of voting for the next president (person) we voted for the next government spending plan (asset)? Systems like patriarchy are fundimentally built upon the principle of people oriented managment.
