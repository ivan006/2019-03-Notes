# Harmony management

## What 
Harmony management is a management technique thats leads to social harmony.
Our lives are hugely impacted by the way we manage them. Some managment techniques lead away from harmony and others towards it.

## How 
I've observed the types of managment techniques that lead away from it are the kinds that are people oriented, and the kinds that lead towards it are asset oriented. 
For management to be asset oriented it must make primary use of assets to help manage. Alternatively for management to be people oriented it must make primary use of people to help manage. 

## Why
I believe this phenomena is due to the fact that assets are more reliable than people as people have limitations that assets do not. 

## Examples
For an example of the difference between asset and people oriented management imagine, for a moment, that instead of relying on a new president (person) we relied on a new government spending plan (asset)? Patriarchy, the system with which we currently operate, is also a good example of disharmony management.
