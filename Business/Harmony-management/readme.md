# Harmony management

## What
Harmony management is a management technique thats leads to social harmony.

Our lives are hugely impacted by the way we manage them. Some managment techniques lead away from harmony and others towards it.

I've observed the types of managment techniques that lead away from it are the kinds that are people oriented, and the kind that lead towards it are asset oriented. I believe this phenomena is due to the fact that assets are more reliable than people as people have limitations that assets do not. Therefore another name for harmony managment could be asset oriented management and its opposite either disharmony managment or people oriented management..

## How
Harmony management is the type that both makes primary use of and focuses on the managment of assets. It's opposite, disharmony management, both makes primary use of and focuses on the management of people. 

For an illustration of the difference between asset and people oriented management imagine, for a moment, that instead of voting for the next president (person) we voted for the next government spending plan (asset)? A good example of people oriented management is patriarchy.
