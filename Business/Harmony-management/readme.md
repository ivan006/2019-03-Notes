# Harmony management

## What 
Harmony management is a management technique thats leads to social harmony.
Our lives are hugely impacted by the way we manage them. Some managment techniques lead away from harmony and others towards it.

## How 
I've observed the types of managment techniques that lead away from it are the kinds that are people oriented, and the kinds that lead towards it are asset oriented. 

Management that is asset oriented makes primary use of assets to help manage. Alternatively management that is people oriented makes primary use of people to help manage. 

For an example imagine, for a moment, that instead of relying on a new president/patriarch (person) we relied on a new government spending plan (asset)?

# Why
I believe this phenomena is due to the fact that assets are more reliable than people as people have limitations that assets do not.
