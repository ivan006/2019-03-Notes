# Destiny code - A political theory

- Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
- Destiny A 
  - What: Disharmony
  - How: When we believe people are the center of life it leads us also to believe that heirarchies of people and thus inequality is natural. These beliefs make us behave in a way that re-enforces inequality onto ourselves. 
- Destiny B 
  - What: Harmony
  - How: When we believe assets are the center of life it leads us to also believe that it is not hierarchies of people but hierarchies of assets, and thus equality, that is natural. These beliefs make us behave in a way that re-enforces equality onto ourselves.
