# Destiny code 
## A political philosophy position

- Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
- We have a people centered perspective.
  - This leads us to believing that heirarchies of people and thus inequality is natural.
  - This motivates us to re-enforce inequality onto ourselves. 
  - This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, university and most companies.
- If we adopted an asset centered perspective it would create equality. 
  - This leads us to believing that it is not hierarchies of people but hierarchies of assets that is natural.
  - This will motivates us to re-enforce equality onto ourselves. 
  - This would cause our schools, universities and companies to become harmonious.
