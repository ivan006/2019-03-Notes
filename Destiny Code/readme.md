# Destiny Code

Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
We have a people centric perspective which leads us to believing that inequality is natural and as a result causes us to re-enforce inequality upon ourselves. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, university and most companies.
If we adopted an asset centric perspective it would create equality. This would cause our schools, universities and companies to be much more harmonious.
