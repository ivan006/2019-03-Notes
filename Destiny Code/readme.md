# Destinyism

This is a political theory.

Our beliefs shape our behaviour which in turn shapes our destiny. 

## Disharmonious destiny  
The nature of a disharmonious destiny is one which is thwarted with social issues.

The cause of a disharmonious destiny is the belief that people are the center of life as this leads to the belief that hierarchies of people and thus inequality is natural. These beliefs make us behave in a way that re-enforces inequality onto ourselves. 

## Harmonious destiny 
The nature of a harmonious destiny is one which is has no social issues. 

The cause of a harmonious destiny is the belief that assets are the center of life as this would lead us to the belief that it is not hierarchies of people but hierarchies of assets, and thus equality, that is natural. These beliefs would make us behave in a way that re-enforces equality onto ourselves.
