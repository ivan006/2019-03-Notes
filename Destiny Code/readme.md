# Destiny Code

Perspective is everything and it shapes our destiny. If we changed our perspective of society from seeing it as hierarchy of people to seeing it as a hierarchy of assets it would end inequality. Our believe in subject centric hierarchy causes us to enforce subject centric hierarchy and thus enforce inequality. 

Our society currently enforces inequality upon itself. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience.
