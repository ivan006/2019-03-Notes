# Destiny Code

Perspective is everything and it shapes our destiny. If we changed our perspective of society from being a people centric hierarchy to being a asset centric hierarchy it would end inequality. 

Our belief in subject centric hierarchy causes us to enforce subject centric hierarchy and thus enforce inequality. 
Our society currently re-enforces inequality upon itself. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience.
