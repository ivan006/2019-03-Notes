# Harmonyism

Harmony cant be created with s-focus (people/subject oriented management) but only with o-focus (asset/document/object oriented management), as people simply aren't as reliable as assets.

For instance imagine that instead of using such a crude system of voting for the next president we had a sophisticated system inwhich we could voted for how the government budget was spent?
