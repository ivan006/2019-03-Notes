# Harmonyism

Harmony cant be created with s-focus but only with o-focus as people simply aren't as reliable as objects.

For instance imagine that instead of using such a crude system of voting for the next president we had a sophisticated system inwhich we could voted for how the government budget was spent?

The former can be called people oriented management, or s-focus for short, and the latter can be called asset or document oriented management, o-focus for short.
