# Destiny Code

Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
Our people centric perspective makes inequality seem natural and causes us to re-enforce inequality upon ourselves. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, university and most companies.
If we adopted an asset centric perspective it would create equality. This would cause our schools, universities and companies to be much more harmonious.
