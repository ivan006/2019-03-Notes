# Harmonyism

Harmony cant be created with p-focus (people oriented management) but only with a-focus (asset/document oriented management), as people simply aren't as reliable as assets.

For instance imagine that instead of using such a crude system of voting for the next president we had a sophisticated system inwhich we could voted for how the government budget was spent?
