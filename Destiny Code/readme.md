# Destiny code 
## A political philosophy position

- Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
- We have a people centered perspective.
- This leads us to believing that inequality is natural.
- This motivates us to re-enforce inequality onto ourselves. 
- This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, university and most companies.
- If we adopted an asset centered perspective it would create equality. 
- This would cause our schools, universities and companies to be much more harmonious.
