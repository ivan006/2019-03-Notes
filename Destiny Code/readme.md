# Harmonyism

Harmony cant be created with people oriented management but only with asset oriented management, as people simply aren't as reliable as assets.

For instance imagine that instead of using such a crude system of voting for the next president we had a sophisticated system inwhich we could voted for how the government budget was spent?

People oriented management can be shortened to s-focus (subject-focus), and the asset or document oriented management can be shortened to o-focus (object-focus).
