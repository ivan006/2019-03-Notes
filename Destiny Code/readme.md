# A-adminism

## Definition
A-adminism is an asset oriented administive approach and aledgedly leads to social harmony

## Note 
### Connection to harmony
The opposite of a-admin is p-admin, which is people oriented. The reason only a-admin can lead to harmony is that people simply aren't as reliable as assets. 

### Example 
For example imagine that instead of voting for the next president we voted for the next government budget spending plan? 

### People and asset orientation
To be more specific p-admin is about "the management of people done by people" and a-admin is about "the management of assets done by assets through people".
