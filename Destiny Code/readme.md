# Destiny Code

Perspective is everything and it shapes our destiny. If we changed our perspective of society from seeing it as hierarchy of people to seeing it as a hierarchy of assets it would end inequality.

Our perspective makes inequality seem natural and causes us to re-enforce it upon ourselves. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience.
