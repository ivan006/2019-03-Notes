# A-adminism

Definition: A-adminism is an asset oriented administive approach and aledgedly leads to social harmony

Note: The opposite of a-admin is p-admin, which is people oriented. The reason only a-admin can lead to harmony is that people simply aren't as reliable as assets. For example imagine that instead of voting for the next president we voted for the next government budget spending plan? To be more specific p-admin is about "the management of people done by people" and a-admin is about "the management of assets done by assets through people".
