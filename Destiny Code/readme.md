# Harmonyism

The economy is capable of creating social harmony. But that can't be attained with p-admin (people oriented management), only with a-admin (asset oriented management), as people simply aren't as reliable as assets.

For example imagine that instead of voting for the next president we voted for how the government budget was spent?

To be specific p-admin is "management of people done by people" and a-admin is "management of assets done by assets through people".
