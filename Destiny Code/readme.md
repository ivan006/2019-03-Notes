# Destiny Code

Weirdo - one who determins their own fate.


## What choices do we have for our destiny?

To live with harmony or dominance.

Harmony is like equality and is about working for a mutual benefit. Dominance is like inequality and is about working for the benefit of only few.

## How can we influence this choice?

To create harmony we must adopt a new way of understanding reality.

Our understanding of reality must shift from being focused on the people in society to being focused on the assets in society.
This is because when we model any system we automatically construct a heirarichal model and a heirarichal model made up of people creates inequality but a heirarchal model made up of assets does not.
The focus on people can be called subjectcentrism (subject meaning person) and the focus on assets can be called objectcentrism (objects meaning assets).

So to create a harmonious destiny we must make sure our understanding of any situation is objectcentric.
