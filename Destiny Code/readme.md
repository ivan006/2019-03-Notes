# Destiny Code

Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
Our people centric perspective makes inequality seem natural and causes us to re-enforce inequality upon ourselves. This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, univercity and most companies.
If we adopted an asset centric perspective it would create equality. One can only imagine what such a world would look and feel like.
