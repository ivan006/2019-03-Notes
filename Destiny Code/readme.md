# Destiny code 
## A political theory

- Our perspective shapes our destiny. 
- Perspective A: We have a people centered perspective.
  - Belief: This leads us to believing that heirarchies of people and thus inequality is natural.
  - Behaviour: This motivates us to re-enforce inequality onto ourselves. 
  - Destiny: This can be seen in the widespread encouragement of obedience like we have in school, university and most companies.
- Perspective B: We could choose to we adopted an asset centered perspective. 
  - Belief: This leads us to believing that it is not hierarchies of people but hierarchies of assets and thus equality that is natural.
  - Behaviour: This will motivates us to re-enforce equality onto ourselves. 
  - Destiny: This would cause our schools, universities and companies to become harmonious.
