## Stage 1 - preparation
### Bed preparation
![](https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/1144/1144062.png)
- Demark your bed layout 
	- Give 70cm by 50cm  spacing for each plant's section
	- Give at least a 10cm width spacing for paths
### Soil tendering

- Airate and weed your soil
	- Dig 1 spade deep and remove weeds, this will take about 30min per plant's section (including paths)

- Fertilise the soil 
	- dig a hole in the middle of each plant's section that is 1 spade wide and 1 spade deep discarding the removed soil
	- Add a total of 10L of compost and mix with the soil a bit

## Stage 2 - sprouting in cloth

### Note
- if the weather is hot this process may go quicker
### Day 1 (feb 2nd and 3rd)
- Planting
	- Wrap courgette seeds in a cloth
	- Wet the seed bundle (for 5 minutes if using thin cloth or just momentarily if using thick cloth)
	- Plant the bundle it in a sunny spot under 5 cm of soil
- Watering - Water bundle spot with a cup of water, after planting the bundle
### Day 3 
- Watering - Water bundle spot with a cup of water
### Day 4 (ours sprouted on this day)
### Day 5 
- Planting
	- Unplant the bundle
	- Retrieve the sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in part 2 of the sprout stage
	- Replant the bundle 
- Watering - water bundle spot with a cup of water, after repanting the bundle
### Day 7  
- Planting
	- Unplant the bundle
	- Retrieve the sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in part 2 of the sprout stage
	- The rest are faulty seed so you can throw them away

## Stage 3 - Continue sprouting in soil

### Day 1 (feb 5nd and 6rd)
- Watering - Water plants section with 5L of water and mix it into the compost before planting 
- Planting
	- After watering make hole in the middle of the compost hole make a small seed hole with your finger 2/3rds of a finger deep
	- Making sure not to damage/touch the sprouted seeds shoot, put 1 seed at the bottom of the hole, sprout side facing down and close the seed hole
### Day 3 
- Watering - Water with 5L
### Day 5 
- Watering - If the plant still hasn't shot above ground water with 3L with watering can 
### Day 6 and onwards 
- Watering - If the plant still hasn't shot above ground water with 1L per day until it does

## Stage 4 - vegetative growth

### Note
- This stage begins as soon as a sprout has shot above ground
- When watering from now on water with a watering can but not directly on the plant
### Day 1    (germ dates: 10th (bat. 2 ) and 13th (bat. 1))
- Watering - Water with 5L
### Day 3 
- Watering - Water with 6L
### Day 6 
- Watering - Water with 6L
### Day 8 (germ dates: 17th (bat. 2 ) and 20th (bat. 1))
- Bed preparation - mulch the plants
- Watering - For the next 2 weeks water with 5L every three days


## Stage 5 - fruit growth

### Note
- This stage begins 3 weeks after the sprout has shot above ground 
### Harvesting
- Now is the time fruits will start appearing
- Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower 
- If you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive over all
### Week 1 - Day 1 (was mean to be feb 5th but did on feb 9th)
- Bed preparation - Move the mulch to the side
- Watering - water with 6L
- Tending the soil 
	- weed the plants safe space
		- the plants safe space is from the stem of the plant all the way to as far as its leaves can reach
		- weed after watering as the watering will help losen the roots of the weeds
		- this will take about 3 minutes per plant  
### Week 1 - Day 2 (3 of the was 2019/03/12, rest was...14th)
- Bed preparation
	- While you tend the soil in the next step make sure to arrange the plants "safe space" soil into a bowl shape for retaining water 
	- After you have finished tending the soil be sure to put the mulch back
- Tending the soil 
	- Airate the soil
		- turn the soil in the plants safe space but not closer than 10cm to the plants stem to a depth of 1/2 a spade, this will take about 4min per plant
	- Feeding
		- make a very shallow circlular groove 10cm from the stem of the plant and lay it with 1 hand full of chicken manure
		- in the plant space evenly spread 10L of compost 
- Watering - water again with 7L

### Week 1 - Day 5
- Watering - From now on, starting today, water with 6L every three days

### Week 3
- Harvesting - your first big harvest will be around this time (my harvest for the week was 1/3kg per plant)

### Week 4, 7, 10 and 13 (week 3: was 16 plants to feed; date was 2019/04/07; used R165 compost; used 10L chicken manure(double what i was meant to); used 112minutes (7min per plant))
- Bed preparation and tending the soil - Repeat the soil tending and bed preparation steps as shown in day 1 and 2  unless the plants are soon to die or are no longer productive
