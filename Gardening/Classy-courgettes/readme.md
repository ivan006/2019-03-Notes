# Phase 1. Sprout part 1
## Resources
- Time: Day 1 - 7
- Food: N/A
- Water: 1 cup every 2 days
- Space: N/A
## Instructions
1. Wrap courgette seeds in a cloth. Soak the bundle (for 5 minutes if using thin cloth or just momentarily if using thick cloth). Plant the bundle in a sunny spot under 5 cm of soil.
2. From day 4 check the bundle every day for sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in the next phase.
3. On day seven discard all the seeds that have not yet sprouted as they are dormant.

# Phase 2. Sprout part 2
## Resources
- Time: Day 8 - 14
- Food: 10L compost / plant section
- Water:
  - 5L / plant section every 2 days (third water is meant to be 3 L but does that just complicate things?)
  - If still not sprouted after 1 week change to 1L every day until it does
- Space:
  - Width: 70cm
 - Length: 50cm
  - Depth: 1 spade
  - Paths: 10cm
# Instructions
1. Demark your bed layout according to the spacing spec
2. Aerate, weed and remove stones from your soil by turning the soil to a depth as shown in the  spacing spec (for estimate on effort it will be about 30min per plant's section)
3. Fertilize the soil by digging out a hole in the middle of each plant's section to a 1 spade diameter and 1 spade depth discarding the removed soil. Add the compost according to feeding spec and mix with the soil a bit.
4. Water plant section with enough water as per watering spec and mix it into the compost before planting
5. After watering make a small finger hole for the seed in the middle of the compost spot 2/3rds of a finger deep.
6. Making sure not to damage/touch the sprouted seeds shoot, put 1 seed at the bottom of the hole, sprout side facing down and close the seed hole
7. Check if each plant has sprouted if so move it to the next phase.

# Phase 3. Vegetation
## Resources
- Time: Day 15 - 36
- Food: N/A
- Water: 5L / plant section every 3 days (second water is meant to be 2 days after first water and 2nd and third water is meant to be 6L but does that just complicate things?)
- Space: N/A

## Instructions
1. When watering from now on, water with a watering can which has a nozzle and not directly on the plant.
2. After 1 week of this phase mulch the plants

# Phase 4. Fruiting
## Resources
- Time: Day 37 - 128
- Food: 
  - 1 hand full of chicken manure / plant section
  - 10L compost / plant section
- Water: 6L / plant section every 3 days (First 2 days water 6L on each day but does that just complicate things?)
- Space: N/A
## Instructions
1. Only do the watering for the day after all the below is preparation steps are done
2. Set the mulch aside and weed each plant section (do this after watering as this will soften the soil) (for estimate on effort it will be about 3 min / plant)
3. Aerate the soil by turning the soil to a depth of half a spade within the plants section but don't go any closer than 10cm to the plants stem. (estimate on effort is about 4min/plant)
4. Arrange the soil into a slight bowl shape to retain water better
5. Make a shallow 10cm radius ring around the stem of each plant and fill it with enough chicken manure as per feeding spec.
6. In the plant section evenly spread enough compost as per feeding spec and keep the bowl shape
7. Put the mulch back
8. Repeat the above steps every 4 weeks unless the plants are no longer productive.
9. Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower (if you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive overall).
10. Your first big harvest will be 3 weeks into the fruiting phase (estimate on yield is about 0.3kg / plant per week)
