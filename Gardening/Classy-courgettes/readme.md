<li aria-level="1">Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower (if you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive overall).</li>
<li aria-level="1">Your first big harvest will be 3 weeks into the fruiting phase (estimate on yield is about 0.3kg / plant per week)</li>
