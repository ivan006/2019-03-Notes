**Instructions:**


- Wrap courgette seeds in a cloth. Soak the bundle (for 5 minutes if using thin cloth or just momentarily if using thick cloth). Plant the bundle in a sunny spot under 5 cm of soil.
- From day 4 check the bundle every day for sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in the next phase.
- On day seven discard all the seeds that have not yet sprouted as they are dormant.

**Instructions:**


- Demark your bed layout according to the spacing spec
- Aerate, weed and remove stones from your soil by turning the soil to a depth as shown in the spacing spec (for estimate on effort it will be about 30min per plant's section)
- Fertilize the soil by digging out a hole in the middle of each plant's section to a 1 spade diameter and 1 spade depth discarding the removed soil. Add the compost according to feeding spec and mix with the soil a bit.
- Water plant section with enough water as per watering spec and mix it into the compost before planting
- After watering make a small finger hole for the seed in the middle of the compost spot 2/3rds of a finger deep.
- Making sure not to damage/touch the sprouted seeds shoot, put 1 seed at the bottom of the hole, sprout side facing down and close the seed hole
- Check if each plant has sprouted if so move it to the next phase.

**Instructions:**


- Only do the watering for the day after all the below is preparation steps are done
- Set the mulch aside and weed each plant section (do this after watering as this will soften the soil) (for estimate on effort it will be about 3 min / plant)
- Aerate the soil by turning the soil to a depth of half a spade within the plants section but don't go any closer than 10cm to the plants stem. (estimate on effort is about 4min/plant)
- Arrange the soil into a slight bowl shape to retain water better
- Make a shallow 10cm radius ring around the stem of each plant and fill it with enough chicken manure as per feeding spec.
- In the plant section evenly spread enough compost as per feeding spec and keep the bowl shape
- Put the mulch back
- Repeat the above steps every 4 weeks unless the plants are no longer productive.
- Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower (if you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive overall).
- Your first big harvest will be 3 weeks into the fruiting phase (estimate on yield is about 0.3kg / plant per week)
