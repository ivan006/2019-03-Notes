	- Wet the seed bundle (for 5 minutes if using thin cloth or just momentarily if using thick cloth)
	- Plant the bundle it in a sunny spot under 5 cm of soil
- Watering - Water bundle spot with a cup of water, after planting the bundle
### Day 3 
- Watering - Water bundle spot with a cup of water
### Day 4 (ours sprouted on this day)
### Day 5 
- Planting
	- Unplant the bundle
	- Retrieve the sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in part 2 of the sprout stage
	- Replant the bundle 
- Watering - water bundle spot with a cup of water, after repanting the bundle
### Day 7  
- Planting
	- Unplant the bundle
	- Retrieve the sprouts that have sprouted and plant them as shown in part 2 of the sprout stage
	- The rest are faulty seed so you can throw them away
## 4. Sprout stage - part 2
### Day 1 (feb 5nd and 6rd)
- Watering - Water plants section with 5L of water and mix it into the compost before planting 
- Planting
	- After watering make hole in the middle of the compost hole make a small seed hole with your finger 2/3rds of a finger deep

### Day 3 
- Watering - Water with 5L
### Day 5 
- Watering - If the plant still hasn't shot above ground water with 3L with watering can 
### Day 6 and onwards 
- Watering - If the plant still hasn't shot above ground water with 1L per day until it does

## 5. Vegetative stage
### Note
- This stage begins as soon as a sprout has shot above ground
- When watering from now on water with a watering can but not directly on the plant
### Day 1    (germ dates: 10th (bat. 2 ) and 13th (bat. 1))
- Watering - Water with 5L
### Day 3 
- Watering - Water with 6L
### Day 6

- Watering - For the next 2 weeks water with 5L every three days


## 6. Fruiting stage

### Note
- This stage begins 3 weeks after the sprout has shot above ground 
### Harvesting
- Now is the time fruits will start appearing
- Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower 
- If you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive over all
### Day 1 
- Bed preparation - Move the mulch to the side
- Watering - water with 6L
- Tending the soil 
	- weed the plants safe space
		- the plants safe space is from the stem of the plant all the way to as far as its leaves can reach
		- weed after watering as the watering will help losen the roots of the weeds
		- this will take about 3 minutes per plant  
### Day 2
- Bed preparation
	- While you tend the soil in the next step make sure to arrange the plants "safe space" soil into a bowl shape for retaining water 
	- After you have finished tending the soil be sure to put the mulch back
- Tending the soil 
	- Airate the soil
		- turn the soil in the plants safe space but not closer than 10cm to the plants stem to a depth of 1/2 a spade
	- Fertilisation
		- put 1 hand full of chicken manure in a circle 10cm from the stem of the plant
		- in the plant space evenly spread 10L of compost 
- Watering - water again with 7L
### Day 5
- Watering - From now on, starting today, water with 6L every three days
### Week 3, 6, 9 and 12
