# ACH (Asset-centric Harmonyism)

## The goal
To create harmony

## The method
- Asset-centrism
- Asset-centrism works by focusing and relying on assets instead of people
- This helps to create harmony because when you rely on people you tend to be easily tricked and let down but when you rely on assets you can build your life on a solid foundation.

## We can look at communism's goal and method and see some similarities

####  The goal

To reduce exploitation and increase equality.

#### The method
- Materialism
- Materialism works by just generally focusing and relying on the material instead of on consciousness
- This helps to increase equality because when you rely on consciousness you tend to believe some conscious individuals are more reliable than others, which is the main argument and cause for inequality.
