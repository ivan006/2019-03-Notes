# ACH (Asset-centric Harmonyism)

## The main idea

### The goal
To create harmony

### The method
- Asset-centrism
- Asset-centrism works by focusing and relying on assets instead of people
- This helps to create harmony because when you rely on people you tend to be easily tricked and let down (especially in romance) but when you rely on assets you can build your life on a solid foundation.

## A side note

### What is the similarity between ACH and communism

####  The goal

To reduce exploitation and increase equality.

#### The method
- Materialism
- Materialism works by just generally focusing and relying on the material instead of on consciousness
- This helps to increase equality because when you rely on consciousness you tend to believe some conscious individuals are more reliable than others, which is the main argument and cause for inequality.
