# Asset-centric Harmonyism

## The main idea

### As an overview

Asset-centric Harmonyism is a philosophy that has
- An associated value
- An associated theoretical framework
- And a name that ends up being a mouthful so can be abreviated as ACH

### The value
To create harmony

### Theoretical framework
- Asset-centrism
- Asset-centrism works by focusing and relying on assets instead of people

### What is the connection between the value and the theoretical framework?
Knowing that assets are more reliable than people helps you to create harmony. This works because when you rely on people you tend to be easily tricked and let down (especially in romance) but when you rely on assets you can build your life on a solid foundation.

## A side note

### What is the similarity between ACH and communism

#### As an overview

Communism is also a philosophy that has
- An associated value
- An associated theoretical framework.
- And a nice short name which doesn't need abbreviating

####  The value

To reduce exploitation and increase equality.

#### Theoretical framework
- Materialism
- Materialism works by just generally focusing and relying on the material.

#### What is the connection between the value and the theoretical framework?
Knowing that the material is more reliable than consciousness helps you to reduce inequality. This works because when you rely on consciousness you tend to believe some conscious individuals are more reliable than others, which is the main argument for inequality.
