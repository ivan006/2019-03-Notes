# Asset-centric Harmonyism

## As an overview

It's a philosophy that has
- An associated value
- And an associated theoretical framework

## Value
Create harmony

## Theoretical framework
- Asset-Centrism
- Asset-Centrism works by focusing and relying on asset instead of people

## The connection between the value and the theoretical framework
Knowing that assets are more reliable than people helps you to create harmony. This works because when you rely on people you tend to be easily let tricked and let down (especially in romance) but when you rely on assets you can build you life on a solid foundation.

## Comparison to communism

### As an overview

Communism is also a philosophy that has
- Associated values
- And and associated theoretical framework.

###  Values

Reduce exploitation and increase equality.

### Theoretical framework
- Materialism
- Materialism works by just generally focusing and relying on the material.

### The connection between the value and the theoretical framework
Now this is speculative so I can only guess. But I'd say it is that knowing that the material is more reliable than consciousness helps you to reduce inequality. This works because when you rely on consciousness you tend to believe some conscious individuals are more relable than others, which is the main argument for inequality.
