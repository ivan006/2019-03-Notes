# Asset-centrism

Assetcentrism is the focus on assets and is the oppoite of people-centrism.
Although accet-centrism is saying that focusing on people isn't important it isn't saying that relationships with people aren't important as relationships are in fact "virtual" assets.

Your philosphy effect the way you manage life. If you use this philosphy then you will create harmony! Asset are more reliable than people.
